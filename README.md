# Concert Logistics Management

This module is utilized to clean and consolidate performer data, then schedule concerts across monthly musical events using the consolidated data.

`compiler.py` is responsible for cleaning and consolidating several databases into a single database. The `assigner.py` script then outputs a final set
of schedulings according to the database input. The code is built primarily on Python, with Pandas used for the data processing modules.
